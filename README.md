# CheckerBoard
Build a playable Checker Board with vanilla Javascript for the Eduonix Live MEAN Stack course.

Below is the requirements, I've added a section to show each players moves (history).

Using what we've learned about Javascript scope, DOM selectors and events, and helper functions, create a playable checkerboard using vanilla Javascript:
* Alternating black and white squares
* Black circles for "me", the player
* Red circles for "computer", the opponent
* Pieces should only be able to move diagonally up on black squares
* Only need to code for one player's moves ("me")

Optional: If possible, try to add random moves for the computer (Hint: Math.random) so it is an actual checker game.ï¿¼
